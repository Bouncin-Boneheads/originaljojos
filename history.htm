The Original Jojo's Story

<p>
<table width=450><tr><td>
In the beginning...

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
A long time ago, in fact 11,600 years ago, there was an eighth continent called Atlantis;
the inhabitants were some of the most creative and talented people on earth.  Some very 
smart people say Atlantis never existed, but with a little imagination and some hints 
from Jojo, we know it really did.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Right at the end of the Pleistocene (pronounced Play-toe-seen) Ice Age there was a giant 
earthquake that sunk Atlantis into the ocean.  After thousands of years of cooling off 
and land mass re-formations, the only thing left at the top of the highest mountain peaks 
were millions of chunks of really cool pieces of volcanic rock.  One day, a boy named 
Jojo stumbled upon these treasures and showed them to his friends.  Soon the word spread 
and children everywhere became fascinated by the bright colors and sparkling crystals that 
were shaped like bones. Jojo, who was also very smart, began to paint faces on some of these 
"bones" and suddenly the "bones" became Boneheads.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Children loved their boneheads and started to collect, trade and play games with these wacky, 
bouncin' bones.  They even named one of them Jojo and the legend grows even now.  Today you 
can collect all 36 of the Original Jojo's *(Sorry they're no longer made out of volcanic rock). 
You can try your skill, match them with your friends or just keep 'em safe.  There's just one 
thing, insist on Original Jojo's  because only Original Jojo's trace their history all the 
way back to the magical lost continent of Atlantis.

*Look for special limited edition painted and plated versions.
